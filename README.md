# SparkProject Task#2

In this project I created a basic dynamic webpage for a credit Transfer using some sample users.
The project consists of two main files namely home.php and transfer.php
The home.php page contains the user details which is loading from the server
The transfer.php transmits the credits from one user to another and redirect to the home.php

To transfer the credits you need to press the transfer button of the user you want and fill the details of the receiver and the amount of Credits and Click Transfer
